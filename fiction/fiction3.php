&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit, not many murder victims die almost a decade after the crime. So when a man succumbs to complications from being shot by a stray bullet nine &nbsp;&nbsp;years earlier, Bosch catches a case in which the body is still fresh, but all other evidence is virtually nonexistent.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Bosch and rookie Detective Lucia Soto, are tasked with solving what turns out to be a highly charged, politically sensitive case. Beginning with the bullet that's been lodged for &nbsp;&nbsp;years in the victim's spine, they must pull new leads from years-old information, which soon reveal that this shooting may have been anything but random.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this gripping new novel, Michael Connelly shows once again why Harry Bosch is "one of the greats of crime fiction" (New York Daily News).
