&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision has haunted him for four years--a young woman lying crumpled in death, her hand outstretched in silent supplication. Harry Bosch was taken off the Angella Benton &nbsp;&nbsp;murder case when the production assistant's death was linked with the violent theft of two million dollars from a movie set. Both files were never closed. Now retired from the &nbsp;&nbsp;L.A.P.D., Bosch is determined to find justice for Angella. Without a badge to open doors and strike fear into the guilty, he's on his own. And even in the face of an opponent more &nbsp;&nbsp;powerful and ruthless than any he's ever encountered, Bosch is not backing down.
