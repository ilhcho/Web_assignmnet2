&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Edgar Roy--an alleged serial killer held in a secure, fortress-like Federal Supermax facility-is awaiting trial. He faces almost certain conviction. Sean King and Michelle Maxwell are &nbsp;&nbsp;called in by Roy's attorney, Sean's old friend and mentor Ted Bergin, to help work the case. But their investigation is derailed before it begins--en route to their first meeting with &nbsp;&nbsp;Bergin, Sean and Michelle find him murdered.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now up to them to ask the questions no one seems to want answered: Is Roy a killer? Who murdered Bergin? With help from some surprising allies, they continue to pursue &nbsp;&nbsp;the case. But the more they dig into Roy's past, the more they encounter obstacles, half-truths, dead-ends, false friends, and escalating threats from every direction. Their &nbsp;&nbsp;persistence puts them on a collision course with the highest levels of the government and the darkest corners of power. In a terrifying confrontation that will push Sean and &nbsp;&nbsp;Michelle to their limits, the duo may be permanently parted.
