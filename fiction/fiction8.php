&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 1920, and both Prohibition and bootlegging are in full swing. When Isaac Bells boss and lifelong friend Joseph Van Dorn is shot and nearly killed leading the high-speed chase &nbsp;&nbsp;of a rum-running vessel, Bell swears to him that he will hunt down the lawbreakers, but he doesnt know what he is getting into. When a witness to Van Dorns shooting is executed &nbsp;&nbsp;in a ruthlessly efficient manner invented by the Russian secret police, it becomes clear that these are no ordinary criminals. Bell is up against a team of Bolshevik assassins and &nbsp;&nbsp;saboteursâ€”and they are intent on overthrowing the government of the United States.
