&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of popular fiction David Baldacci is far ahead of the competition. Continuing his string of New York Times bestsellers, Baldacci presents his most electrifying story to &nbsp;&nbsp;date-a novel of nonstop action, vividly etched characters, and an astounding vision of the inner sanctums of our government. Not far from Washington, D.C., in a wooded area of &nbsp;&nbsp;Northern Virginia, a small house at the end of a gravel road serves a secret purpose. With its sophisticated security apparatus and hidden miniaturized cameras, it is being used by &nbsp;&nbsp;the FBI to interview one of the most important witnesses the agency has ever had, a young woman with an incredible story to tell. But a few people know about the secret meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;And for them, a violent drama is about to begin. One man-a local private investigator named Lee Adams-has come to the house on the orders of his client. Another man, a hired &nbsp;&nbsp;killer, stakes out the house on orders from his powerful paymasters. And the witness, Faith Lockhart, is coming to tell the FBI everything she knows about the powerful lobbyist with &nbsp;&nbsp;whom she has worked, a man who manipulates U.S. government policy and who, in the process, made some very dangerous enemies. Then, before Faith can tell her story, the &nbsp;&nbsp;hit man pulls the trigger and the wrong victim falls. Now Faith Lockhart is on the run-from the most dangerous people in America-with Lee Adams, a man she doesn't know, yet &nbsp;&nbsp;must trust. A relentless chase novel that unfolds as both the FBI and a killer search for Faith and Lee, this is also a searing and utterly suspenseful tale of power gone mad in &nbsp;&nbsp;Washington, and of one woman's desperate attempt to break out of a web of corruption and terror that reaches much further than even she can know. In the hands of master &nbsp;&nbsp;storyteller David Baldacci, Saving Faith elevates the thriller to a new level and poses stunning questions about the rules we live by, the rules we are governed by-and what &nbsp;&nbsp;happens when some people make rules of their own...
