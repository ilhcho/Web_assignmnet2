&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On New Year's Day, a dog finds a bone in the Hollywood Hills--and unearths a murder committed more than twenty years earlier. It's a cold case, but for Detective Harry Bosch, it &nbsp;&nbsp;stirs up memories of his childhood as an orphan. He can't let it go. As the investigation takes Bosch deeper into the past, a beautiful rookie cop brings him alive in the present. No &nbsp;&nbsp;official warning can break them apart--or prepare Bosch for the explosions when the case takes a few hard turns. Suddenly all of L.A. is in an uproar, and Bosch, fighting to keep &nbsp;&nbsp;control, is driven to the brink of an unimaginable decision.
