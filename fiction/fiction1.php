&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Agent Pendergast arrives at an exclusive Colorado ski resort to rescue his protégée, Corrie Swanson, from serious trouble with the law. His sudden appearance coincides &nbsp;&nbsp;with the first attack of a murderous arsonist who--with brutal precision--begins burning down multimillion-dollar mansions with the families locked inside. After springing Corrie from &nbsp;&nbsp;jail, Pendergast learns she made a discovery while examining the bones of several miners who were killed 150 years earlier by a rogue grizzly bear. Her finding is so astonishing &nbsp;&nbsp;that it, even more than the arsonist, threatens the resort's very existence.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn deeper into the investigation, Pendergast uncovers a mysterious connection between the dead miners and a fabled, long-lost Sherlock Holmes story--one that might just &nbsp;&nbsp;offer the key to the modern day killings as well.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the ski resort snowed in and under savage attack--and Corrie's life suddenly in grave danger--Pendergast must solve the enigma of the past before the town of the &nbsp;&nbsp;present goes up in flames.
