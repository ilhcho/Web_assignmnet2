&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indiana, 1818. Moonlight falls through the dense woods that surround a one-room cabin, where a nine-year-old Abraham Lincoln kneels at his suffering mother's bedside. She's &nbsp;&nbsp;been stricken with something the old-timers call "Milk Sickness."<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"My baby boy..." she whispers before dying.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Only later will the grieving Abe learn that his mother's fatal affliction was actually the work of a vampire.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the truth becomes known to young Lincoln, he writes in his journal, "henceforth my life shall be one of rigorous study and devotion. I shall become a master of mind and &nbsp;&nbsp;body. And this mastery shall have but one purpose..." Gifted with his legendary height, strength, and skill with an ax, Abe sets out on a path of vengeance that will lead him all the &nbsp;&nbsp;way to the White House.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;While Abraham Lincoln is widely lauded for saving a Union and freeing millions of slaves, his valiant fight against the forces of the undead has remained in the shadows for &nbsp;&nbsp;hundreds of years. That is, until Seth Grahame-Smith stumbled upon The Secret Journal of Abraham Lincoln, and became the first living person to lay eyes on it in more than 140 &nbsp;&nbsp;years.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the journal as his guide and writing in the grand biographical style of Doris Kearns Goodwin and David McCullough, Seth has reconstructed the true life story of our greatest &nbsp;&nbsp;president for the first time-all while revealing the hidden history behind the Civil War and uncovering the role vampires played in the birth, growth, and near-death of our nation. <br>
