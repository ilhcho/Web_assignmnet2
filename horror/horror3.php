&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank Pollard awakens in an alley, knowing nothing but his name - and that he is in great danger. Having taken refuge in a motel, he wakes again only to find his hands covered in &nbsp;&nbsp;blood. As far as he knows, he's no killer. But whose blood is this, and how did it get there? Over the next few days Frank develops a fear of sleep, because each time he wakes he &nbsp;&nbsp;discovers strange objects in his hands and pockets - objects far more frightening than blood. Husband-and-wife detective team Bobby and Julie Dakota specialize in high-ticket &nbsp;&nbsp;corporate security investigations, but when a distraught and desperate Frank Pollard begs them to watch over him, they can't refuse. Out of compassion - and curiosity - they &nbsp;&nbsp;agree to get to the bottom of his mysterious, amnesiac fugues. It seems a simple job: just follow a client who wants to be watched and tell him where he winds up. But as the &nbsp;&nbsp;Dakotas begin to discover where their client goes when he sleeps, they are drawn slowly into ever-darkening realms where they encounter the ominous figure stalking Frank. Their &nbsp;&nbsp;lives are threatened, as is that of Julie's gentle, Down's-syndrome brother, Thomas. To Thomas, death is the bad place from which there is no return. But Julie and Bobby - and &nbsp;&nbsp;their tortured client - ultimately learn that equally bad places exist in the world of the living, places so steeped in evil that in contrast death seems almost a relief... Praise for Dean &nbsp;&nbsp;Koontz A master storyteller, sometimes humorous, sometimes shocking, but always riveting. His characters sparkle with life. And his fast-paced plots are wonderfully fiendish, &nbsp;&nbsp;taking unexpected twists and turns. - The San Diego Union-Tribune One of our finest and most versatile suspense writers. - The Macon Telegraph & News His prose &nbsp;&nbsp;mesmerizes...Koontz consistently hits the bull's-eye. - Arkansas Democrat An exceptional novelist...top-notch. - Lincoln Journal-Star
