&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Critically celebrated novelist Scott Spencer delivers a Rosemary's Baby-like novel of gothic horror, set against the backdrop of modern-day Upper East Side Manhattan.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex and Leslie Twisden lead charmed lives-fabulous jobs, a luxurious town house on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a passionate marriage. What they don't have is a child, and as &nbsp;&nbsp;they try one infertility treatment after the next, yearning turns into obsession. As a last-ditch attempt to make their dream of parenthood come true, Alex and Leslie travel deep into &nbsp;&nbsp;Slovenia, where they submit to a painful and terrifying procedure that finally gives them what they so fervently desire . . . but with awful consequences.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years later, cosseted and adored but living in a house of secrets, the twins Adam and Alice find themselves locked into their rooms every night, with sounds coming from their &nbsp;&nbsp;parents' bedroom getting progressively louder, more violent, and more disturbing.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Driven to a desperate search for answers, Adam and Alice set out on a quest to learn the true nature of the man and woman who raised them. Their discovery will upend &nbsp;&nbsp;everything they thought they knew about their parents and will reveal a threat so horrible that it must be escaped, at any cost.
