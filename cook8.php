Most homes built in the United States over the last fifty years were merely plopped down on a piece of land without any real integration of house and site. The result is a suburban sprawl of homes that are as uninspiring as they are environmentally unsustainable. House in the Landscape offers a viable alternative for landowners who want to build in a more thoughtful manner. Twenty-two houses by some of today's best-known residential architects illustrate nine site types from all over the United States. Each site, the issues it posed, the solutions the architects found, andthe resulting house design are discussed and explained in detail, providing a wealth of siting information for the reader.
