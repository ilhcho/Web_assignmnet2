&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Private investigator Cormoran Strike returns in a new mystery from Robert Galbraith, author of the #1 international bestseller The Cuckoo's Calling.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike. At first, Mrs. Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few days--as &nbsp;&nbsp;he has done before--and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realizes. The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous &nbsp;&nbsp;pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. If the novel were to be published, it would ruin lives--meaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silenced.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any Strike has &nbsp;&nbsp;encountered before...<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A compulsively readable crime novel with twists at every turn, THE SILKWORM is the second in the highly acclaimed series featuring Cormoran Strike and his determined young &nbsp;&nbsp;assistant, Robin Ellacott.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once again writing under the pseudonym Galbraith, J.K. Rowling begins her new fair-play whodunit a few months after the conclusion of The Cuckoo's Calling (2013). Here, &nbsp;&nbsp;London private eye Comoran Strike and his almost aggressively efficient assistant, Robin Ellacott, are searching for the murderer of novelist Owen Quine, the author of a scurrilous &nbsp;&nbsp;roman Ã  clef certain to damage the careers of an assortment of publishing power players if printed. Popular British actor Glenister (MI-5, Hustle) takes on a highly-charged crime &nbsp;&nbsp;puzzle, peopled by a panoply of mainly vile suspects as well as a totally engaging pair of detectives. Matching Rowling's praiseworthy ear for dialogue, he catches the subtleties — &nbsp;&nbsp;a touch of snark in cocktail party chatter, the arrogance in the voice of the overprivileged, the fear almost hidden in the raspy croak of a chain-smoking literary agent. His Strike &nbsp;&nbsp;shifts from a weary attitude when dealing with his personal life to an air of vitality and confidence when on the job. Robin, too, is at her best when working, sounding bright and on &nbsp;&nbsp;top of things; while at home, her conversation is dulled by her increasing uncertainty about marriage to fiancÃ©. This developing doubt seems justified, since the husband-to-be, as &nbsp;&nbsp;Glenister's interpretation perfectly captures, is a demanding and humorless bore. A Little, Brown/Mulholland hardcover.
