&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the award-winning author of One False Move comes Harlan Coben's most mesmerizing and emotionally charged novel to date.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Myron Bolitar, sports agent and reluctant sleuth, is happily basking in the sun of the Caribbean, clearing his head with a woman he hardly knows, when Win, his loyal but morally &nbsp;&nbsp;questionable sidekick, arrives to tell him that Esperanza, Myron's partner at MB SportsReps and best friend, has been arrested for the murder of Clu Haid, a fallen baseball star &nbsp;&nbsp;and Bolitar client.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Myron returns to the city immediately to prove Esperanza's innocence. But she isn't speaking. And neither is her lawyer, except to say that Myron and Win should keep their &nbsp;&nbsp;distance lest they hurt her case. But he is determined to help her, even against her own wishes--because, for Myron, this one is personal.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;As he plunges into his most difficult and bizarre case yet, Myron finds himself scouring the strangest angles: a transsexual nightclub, a Yankee owner with a long-lost daughter, a &nbsp;&nbsp;dubious drug test, an impossible murder scene, and a computer disk with the image of a disintegrating girl. And as he tries to unearth a killer amid a tangled trail of lies, Myron's &nbsp;&nbsp;own investigation points to only one other suspect: himself . . . as this spellbinding novel twists, jolts, and careens toward its dazzling finish.<br>
