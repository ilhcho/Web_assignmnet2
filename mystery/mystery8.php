&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;James Lee Burke, acclaimed by critics as "America's best novelist," "the Graham Greene of the bayou," and "a poet of the mystery novel," returns with his popular character, Dave &nbsp;&nbsp;Robicheaux, in a novel rich with atmosphere, ripe with menace, and filled with the kind of crackling dialogue that has made Burke a consistent New York Times best-selling author.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When a beautiful teenage girl is killed, the victim of a particularly savage rape, New Iberia, Louisiana, police detective Dave Robicheaux senses from the very start of the &nbsp;&nbsp;investigation that the most likely suspect, Tee Bobby Hulin, is not the actual killer. Though a drug addict and general ne'er-do-well, Hulin just doesn't fit the profile for this kind of &nbsp;&nbsp;brutal crime.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;But when another murder occurs — this victim a drugged-out prostitute who happens to be the daughter of one of the local mafia bigwigs — all clues once again point to Tee &nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby Hulin, and the cries for arrest become too loud to ignore. The dead girl's father, however, prefers to take matters in his own hands and sets out to find — and punish — the &nbsp;&nbsp;killer himself.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;But before Robicheaux can solve these crimes and bring the killer or killers to justice, he is forced to battle his own inner demons, including a painkiller addiction, a habit that &nbsp;&nbsp;begins as the result of a brutal and humiliating beating he suffers at the hands of the mysterious and diabolical character known as Legion. A fixture in the area for years, Legion &nbsp;&nbsp;was once the overseer on a local sugarcane plantation and now gets by doing odd jobs. In temperament, however, he's still the malicious and malevolent bully he always was, a &nbsp;&nbsp;man defined by evil and seemingly possessed with supernatural skills of survival.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Added to the mix, and on the good guy side of the balance sheet, is Clete Purcel, a longtime buddy of Robicheaux's and a confirmed boozer and womanizer. Clete comes to New &nbsp;&nbsp;Iberia for a visit and is quickly drawn into the struggle between the various forces of evil in the town, including Jimmy Dean Styles, a black man intent on maintaining his empire of &nbsp;&nbsp;corruption; Joe Zeroski, a trailer park mafioso with palatial aspirations — and of course, Legion Guidry, the devil incarnate, in whom Robicheaux finds himself facing a challenge &nbsp;&nbsp;and an enemy unlike any he has ever known. And soon, what began as a duel of wits has turned into a dance of death.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gothic, dense, brutal, touching, and always compelling, Jolie Blon's Bounce is classic storytelling from a writer who has been dubbed "the Faulkner of crime fiction."<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses:</strong>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bestselling author Burke's most popular character, Dave Robicheaux, returns in this suspenseful story of two brutal murders in New Iberia, Louisiana. When a beautiful teenage &nbsp;&nbsp;girl is killed, Robicheaux immediately senses that the most likely suspect, Tee Bobby Hulin, is not the real murderer. Unabridged.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses:</strong>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;New Iberia, Louisiana, is reeling from a one-two punch of brutal rape-homicides, and drug-addicted blues singer Tee Bobby Hulin has been tagged as the prime suspect. No &nbsp;&nbsp;stranger to bucking popular opinion, police detective Dave Robicheaux senses it's not Hulin behind the atrocities. With his longtime friend, Clete Purcel, Robicheaux treads among &nbsp;&nbsp;land mines of injustice, mob payoffs, and deadly secrets, all the while guessing: whom can he trust and whom should he fear?<br>
