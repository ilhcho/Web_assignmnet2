&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Boston, 1926. The â€˜20s are roaring. Liquor is flowing, bullets are flying, and one man sets out to make his mark on the world.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prohibition has given rise to an endless network of underground distilleries, speakeasies, gangsters, and corrupt cops. Joe Coughlin, the youngest son of a prominent Boston &nbsp;&nbsp;police captain, has long since turned his back on his strict and proper upbringing. Now having graduated from a childhood of petty theft to a career in the pay of the city's most &nbsp;&nbsp;fearsome mobsters, Joe enjoys the spoils, thrills, and notoriety of being an outlaw.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe embarks on a dizzying journey up the ladder of organized crime that takes him from the flash of Jazz Age Boston to the sensual shimmer of Tampa's Latin Quarter to the &nbsp;&nbsp;sizzling streets of Cuba. At once a sweeping love story and a compelling saga of revenge, it is a spellbinding tour de force of betrayal and redemption, music and murder, that &nbsp;&nbsp;brings fully to life a bygone era when sin was cause for celebration and vice was a national virtue.
