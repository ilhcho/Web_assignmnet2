<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>Called on a dangerous assignment, leopard shifter Conner Vega returns to the Panama rain forest of his homeland, looking every bit the civilized male. But as a member of the most lethal of the shifter tribes, he doesn?t have a civilized bone in his body. He carries the scent of a wild animal in its prime, he bears the soul-crushing sins of past kills and he's branded with the scars of shame inflicted by the woman he betrayed.Isabeau Chandler is a Borneo shifter who's never forgiven Conner ? or forgotten him. The mating urge is still with her, and when she crosses Conner's path, passions burn like wildfire. But as Conner's mission draws Isabeau closer, another betrayal lies waiting in the shadows ? and it's the most perilous and intimate one of all.<br>

<br>Leopard shifter Conner Vega carries the scent of a wild animal in its prime, and bears the soul-crushing sins of past betrayals. Isabeau Chandler's never forgiven him--or forgotten him. The mating urge is still with her, and hotter than ever.
