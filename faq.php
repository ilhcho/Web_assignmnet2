		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<strong>Q: When should I start ordering my textbooks?</strong>
		<br />
		A: As soon as possible to insure that your book is available and possibly at a better price. Also, you might save shipping by ordering early. If you drop the course or the instructor changes books, you can return the book within 14 days after you received it.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Q: When ordering a textbook, what is the most important piece of information?</strong>
		<br />
		A: The single most important piece of information one should have is the ISBN. The ISBN will be particular to each edition. There will also be different ISBNs for hardcovers and paperbacks. Always check with your instructor for the ISBN and edition you will need for your class.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Q: Is there anything else I need to know?</strong>
		<br />
		A: If there are different volumes to your textbook, you will need to know what volumes are required.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Q: What is the difference between a textbook listed for $100 and the same edition or ISBN for $8?</strong>
		<br />
		A: The $8 will be the study guide or solutions manual. If it looks too good to be true, it is.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Q: Can I have a book transferred to one your stores so I can pick it up?</strong>
		<br />
		A: Most of our textbooks are stocked in a remote warehouse and are only available for shipping. Some titles in our warehouses can be transferred to stores to be picked up. Please call for availability and a timeframe. Some books, while they can be transferred, will take 7-10 business days to reach a store. So, again, please order early.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Q: What type of shipping should I chose?</strong>
		<br />
		A: We have some of the most affordable 2nd Day Air rates in the business â€” $8.99 per order plus $2.99 per book. Click here for more info on shipping.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Q: What about Economy Mail? What if I want to spend less on shipping?</strong>
		<br />
		A: Economy Mail is very slow. It averages 4-9 business days, but can take up 5 weeks. If you need your order soon DO NOT send it Economy Mail.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Q: How do I get free shipping?</strong>
		<br />
		A: Place an order for $50 or more, and we'll ship it via Economy Mail to anywhere in the U.S. free of charge. Note that shipping costs and taxes are not included in the $50 total, and titles shelved at our Partner and International Warehouses do not qualify. You can get more details by clicking here.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Q: What does "student owned" condition mean?</strong>
		<br />
		A: It may be highlighted, contain writing, have minor exterior damage, and so forth. Think about how your books look at the end of a term.
		<br /><br />
		<strong>Q: What does "text only" mean?</strong>
		<br />
		A: No study guide, no solutions manual, no CD-ROM. Literally just the textbook. If it comes with a CD-ROM it will say so in the title.
