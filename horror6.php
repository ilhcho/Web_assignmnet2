<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
KOKO. Only four men knew what it meant. Now they must stop it. They are Vietnam vets ? a doctor, a lawyer, a working stiff, and a writer. Very different from each other, they are nonetheless linked by a shared history and a single shattering secret. Now, they have been reunited and are about to embark on a quest that will take them from Washington, D.C., to the graveyards and fleshpots of the Far East to the human jungle of New York, hunting someone from the past who has risen from the darkness to kill and kill and kill. A masterpiece of terror.? ?Los Angeles Times Complexly plotted, thickly layered evil. . . . The ultimate horror.? ?The New York Times Book Review A dead-center hit. . . . A gripping, enthralling, nonstop read.? ?San Francisco Chronicle
