An essential collection of more than 100 foolproof recipes from food luminaries such as Julia Child, Alice Waters, and David Chang â€” curated, introduced, and photographed by the team behind the leading food website Food52.<br>

<br>This debut title from Food52 Works, a new imprint from Ten Speed Press, draws from Food52's James Beard Award-nominated Genius Recipes column, which features inventive recipes that rethink cooking tropes and, simply put, are nothing short of genius. In this inspired book for the modern cook, Food52's executive editor Kristen Miglore combines new genius recipes, greatest hits from the column, and her own kitchen wisdom in a sleek, lushly illustrated package. Whether it's fail-safe Fried Chicken from Michael Ruhlman or the imaginative Black Pepper Tofu from Yotam Ottolenghi, once you try these recipes, you'll never need to go back to other versions. Plus with abundant how-to and finished dish photographs throughout, Genius Recipes is destined to become every home cook's go-to reference for smart, enjoyable cooking.
