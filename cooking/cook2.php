<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>Food plays a very special role in Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein's award-winning satire Portlandia. Here are recipes for the dishes that define the show, from cult-raised chicken and Stu's stews to pickled veggies and foraged green salads. Complete with new full-color finished food photographs and illustrations, humorous stories and sidebars from the loveable food-obsessed Portlandia characters (such as Mr. Mayor, Peter and Nance, and Colin the chicken), and advice on how to choose a bed and breakfast and behave at a communal table, this is a funny cookbook — with serious recipes — for anyone who loves food. And yes, the chicken's local.<br>
