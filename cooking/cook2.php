<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>The companion cookbook to the hit show Portlandia by the Emmy-nominated stars and writers Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein, with 50 delicious recipes for every food lover, freegan, organic farmer, and food truck diehard.<br>
</p>

<p>
Food plays a very special role in Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein's award-winning satire Portlandia. Here are recipes for the dishes that define the show, from cult-raised chicken and Stu's stews to pickled veggies and foraged green salads. Complete with new full-color finished food photographs and illustrations, humorous stories and sidebars from the loveable food-obsessed Portlandia characters (such as Mr. Mayor, Peter and Nance, and Colin the chicken), and advice on how to choose a bed and breakfast and behave at a communal table, this is a funny cookbook — with serious recipes — for anyone who loves food. And yes, the chicken's local.
