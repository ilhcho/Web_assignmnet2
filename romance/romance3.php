&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Berry Knudson had a talent for disaster, but when she climbed a tree to rescue a kitten, she wasn't prepared for the scrumptious hunk undressing in a nearby window, or her dive &nbsp;&nbsp;downward that smashed Jake Sawyer's pizza and won his heart! But was there room in her chaotic schedule for a risk-taking inventor with dreams? She took classes, delivered &nbsp;&nbsp;pizzas, and cared for three eccentric old ladies she rescued from the train station. But Jake thrived on a challenge, and he could be very inventive. Could he teach her there was &nbsp;&nbsp;time to make butterscotch pudding and let herself be loved?<BR>
