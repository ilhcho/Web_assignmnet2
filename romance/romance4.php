&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Called on a dangerous assignment, leopard shifter Conner Vega returns to the Panama rain forest of his homeland, looking every bit the civilized male. But as a member of the &nbsp;&nbsp;most lethal of the shifter tribes, he doesn?t have a civilized bone in his body. He carries the scent of a wild animal in its prime, he bears the soul-crushing sins of past kills and he's &nbsp;&nbsp;branded with the scars of shame inflicted by the woman he betrayed.Isabeau Chandler is a Borneo shifter who's never forgiven Conner ? or forgotten him. The mating urge is still &nbsp;&nbsp;with her, and when she crosses Conner's path, passions burn like wildfire. But as Conner's mission draws Isabeau closer, another betrayal lies waiting in the shadows ? and it's the &nbsp;&nbsp;most perilous and intimate one of all.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Leopard shifter Conner Vega carries the scent of a wild animal in its prime, and bears the soul-crushing sins of past betrayals. Isabeau Chandler's never forgiven him--or forgotten &nbsp;&nbsp;him. The mating urge is still with her, and hotter than ever.
