    &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;With a dagger in her hand and vengeance on her mind, Darkhaven beauty Elise Chase prowls Boston's streets in search of retribution against the Rogue vampires who took from &nbsp;&nbsp;her everything she cherished. Using an extraordinary psychic gift, she tracks her prey, well aware that the power she possesses is destroying her. She must learn to harness this &nbsp;&nbsp;gift, and for that she can turn to only one man: the deadliest of the Breed warriors, Tegan.<br>

    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;No stranger to loss, Tegan knows Elise's pain. He knows fury, but when he slays his enemies it is with ice in his veins. He is perfect in his self-control, until Elise seeks his aid in her &nbsp;&nbsp;personal war. An unholy alliance is forged—a bond that will link them by blood and vow—and plunge them into a tempest of danger, desire, and the darkest passions of the heart.
