<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>
When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms.<BR>

<BR>Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.<br>

<br>Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.<br>

<br>"In James's controversial and wildly popular first-person erotic romance, co-ed Anastasia Steele is drawn into a dark relationship with a wealthy man named Christian Grey, who is seeking a submissive for his sexually dominant desires. But what Ana and Christian find instead is unexpected companionship and mutual respect. Becca Battoe, whose reading captures the spirit of easygoing, innocent, and educated Anastasia, narrates this endearing audio edition. Battoe's reading is crisp, clean, and well paced. Her version of the inexperienced Ana is full of wonder, horror, and amazement, and she nimbly handles the book's more steamy moments. For the other characters, Battoe offers up understated renderings — capturing the characters as Ana sees them. Fans of the series — or erotic fiction in general — will be delighted.
