<strong>Synopses and review:</strong><br>A young woman makes a terrible confession to a priest. An honorable man takes his own revenge for an unspeakable tragedy. An aging inspector tries to get himself sober while taking on the most difficult case of his career. From this beginning, Deon Meyer weaves a story of astonishing complexity and suspense, as Inspector Benny Griessel faces off against a dangerous vigilante who has everything on his side, including public sympathy.<br>

<br>A gruesome abuse case has hit the newsstands, and one man has taken it upon himself to stand up for the children of Cape Town. When the accused is found stabbed through the heart by spear, its only the beginning of a string of bloody murders&#8212;and of a dangerous dilemma for detective Griessel. The detective is always just one step behind as someone slays the citys killers. <br>

<br>But the paths of Griessel and the avenger collide when a young prostitute lures them both into a dangerous plan&#8212;and the two find themselves with a heart-stopping problem that no system of justice could ever make right.<br>

<br>"Meyer's superbly crafted South African thriller follows the interconnected lives of three characters: Christine van Rooyen, a beautiful but luckless Capetown prostitute who gets on the bad side of the brother of a Colombian drug lord; Thobela Mpayipheli, a former mercenary whose retirement ends with the murder of his eight-year-old son; and veteran police inspector Benny Griessel, an alcoholic burnout struggling to regain sobriety and the respect of his family and co-workers. Narrator Simon Vance turns in a successful performance in this audio edition. When Benny's mood swings from despair to hope, Vance's hoarse croak reflects the changes. Similarly, the narrator's rendition of Thobela changes from an initial paternal cheeriness when speaking with his son to despair at the boy's death and stoic flatness as he sets out on his quest for vengeance. Emotions run high throughout, and Vance successfully conveys every moment of despair and elation. But it's near the novel's end — when the plot strands connect in a suspenseful and violent confrontation — that Vance pulls out all the stops, adding a notable finishing touch to this compelling presentation.
